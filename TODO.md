# Unity Multiplayer Soccer - TODO List

- Autoscaling (Down)
    - When we tell the nodescaler process to terminate, stop the loop
- Make it so a player can't go into the goal area
- Show "GOAL" when a goal happens
- Put a highlight on the goal you are aiming for, so you can tell which is which
- Deal with disconnections/reconnections
- Animate paddle on kick
- Have multiple clusters around the world.
